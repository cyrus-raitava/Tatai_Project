# Assignment 3

This application is built for training and recognition of MƒÅori numbers, targeted towards smaller children. The GUI is implemented via JavaFX and Scenebuilder, with the main functionality being performed through Bash Scripting, and ProcessBuilder.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. In order to run the application on a clean version of the Virtual Machine provided by Catherine Watson for this assignment, one must first perform the following commands from the command line, within the Virtual Machine:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install openjfx
```

Following from this, the user must make the application jar executable: locate where the file is and change directory to that location, then either perform 'chmod a+x Tatai.jar' or 'chmod 777 Tatai.jar', in order to make it executable. From here, simply clicking on the application should run it fine.

# NOTE THIS APPLICATION RELIES ON THE LOCATIONS OF ALL THE HTK FILES BEING RELATIVELY THE SAME AS THE LOCATIONS OF THE HTK FILES PROVIDED IN THE VIRTUAL MACHINE FROM CATHERINE WATSON.

Enjoy!
